	abstract  = {Computational scientists often need to execute large, loosely-coupled parallel applications such as workflows and bags of tasks in order to do their research. These applications are typically composed of many, short-running, serial tasks, which frequently demand large amounts of computation and storage. In order to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, scientists would like to execute these applications using petascale resources. In the past this has been a challenge because petascale systems are not designed to execute such workloads efficiently. In this paper we describe a new approach to executing large, fine-grained workflows on distributed petascale systems. Our solution involves partitioning the workflow into independent subgraphs, and then submitting each subgraph as a self-contained MPI job to the available resources (often remote). We describe how the partitioning and job management has been implemented in the Pegasus Workflow Management System. We also explain how this approach provides an end-to-end solution for challenges related to system architecture, queue policies and priorities, and application reuse and development. Finally, we describe how the system is being used to enable the execution of a very large seismic hazard analysis application on XSEDE resources.},

The recent trends in digital computer technology are examined in order to establish the fact that distributed processing is now an accepted philosophy for further developments. The impact of this on the analysis and design practices of structural engineering is assessed by first examining these practices from a data processing standpoint to identify the key operations and data bases, and then fitting them to the characteristics of distributed processing. The merits and drawbacks of the present philosophy in educating structural engineers are discussed and projections are made for the industry-academia relations in the distributed processing environment of structural analysis and design. An ongoing experiment of distributed computing in a University environment is described.}

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions.OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps.METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews.RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined.CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

abstract = {Context
In a previous study, we reported on a systematic literature review (SLR), based on a manual search of 13 journals and conferences undertaken in the period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2007.
Objective
The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search.
Method
We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study.
Results
Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines.
Conclusion
SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology. They are addressing a wide range of topics but still have limitations, such as often failing to assess primary study quality.}

Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR ) is essential. Method: We conducted an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified, strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified primary MDS studies. For example, regarding security modelling artefact, we found that developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches. The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the identified primary MDS studies into 5 significant MDS studies, and other emerging or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the application of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy with database searching. This combination has delivered an extensive literature study on MDS.}

Methodologically we used an adaptation of guidelines aimed at the construction of a SMS (Systematic Mapping Study). Additionally, we performed an analysis of the papers to recognize inferences and trends in them, which allowed us to claim that cloud computing technology plays a predominant role. We consider it good practice for implementations that support research processes. In this sense, we recommend to those interested in this topic to prioritize cloud technologies to achieve an adequate management of the set of IT resources and services used to support Science Gateway environments.},

The aims of this study were to investigate the elements of content validity; to describe a practical approach for assessing content validity; and to discuss existing content validity indices. This is a narrative review of the assessment and quantification of content validity. It describes the key stages of conducting the content validation study and discusses the quantification and evaluation of the content validity estimates. Content validity provides evidence about the degree to which elements of an assessment instrument are relevant to and representative of the targeted construct for a particular assessment purpose. The assessment of content validity relies on using a panel of experts to evaluate instrument elements and rate them based on their relevance and representativeness to the content domain. It is a three-stage process that includes; the development stage, judgment and quantifying stage, and revising and reconstruction stage. To quantify the expert judgments, several indices have been discussed in this paper such as the content validity ratio (CVR), content validity index (CVI), modifiedâKappa, and some agreement indices. A practical guide describes the process of content validity evaluation is provided. In summary, content validation processes and content validity indices are essential factors in the instrument development process, should be treated and reported as important as other types of construct validation. Determining item CVI and reporting an overall CVI are important components necessary to instruments especially when the instrument is used to measure health outcomes or to guide a clinical decision making. Content validity deserves a rigorous assessment process as the obtained information from this process are invaluable for the quality of the newly developed instrument.}
