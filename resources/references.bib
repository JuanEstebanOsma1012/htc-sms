abstract = {Computational scientists often need to execute large, loosely-coupled parallel applications such as workflows and bags of tasks in order to do their research. These applications are typically composed of many, short-running, serial tasks, which frequently demand large amounts of computation and storage. In order to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, scientists would like to execute these applications using petascale resources. In the past this has been a challenge because petascale systems are not designed to execute such workloads efficiently. In this paper we describe a new approach to executing large, fine-grained workflows on distributed petascale systems. Our solution involves partitioning the workflow into independent subgraphs, and then submitting each subgraph as a self-contained MPI job to the available resources (often remote). We describe how the partitioning and job management has been implemented in the Pegasus Workflow Management System. We also explain how this approach provides an end-to-end solution for challenges related to system architecture, queue policies and priorities, and application reuse and development. Finally, we describe how the system is being used to enable the execution of a very large seismic hazard analysis application on XSEDE resources.},

abstract = {At present, there is a proliferation of virtualization technologies (VTs), which are part of the basic and underlying infrastructure of popular cloud computing. Those interested in VTs are faced with a non-unified volume of information and various approaches to modes of operation, classification structures, and the performance implications of these technologies. This makes it difficult to decide which type of VT is appropriate for a particular context. Therefore, this paper reviews the state of the art on VT taxonomic models. Methodologically, a literature review is carried out to identify VT classification models, recognizing their features and weaknesses. With this in mind, a new taxonomy of virtualization technologies is proposed, which responds to the weaknesses identified in the analyzed schemes. The new VT taxonomy combines the Abstraction Level and Virtual Machine Type approaches, providing the reader with a means to visualize VTs. In doing so, the reader can locate the level of abstraction at which each VT is developed, in addition to the type of machine projected, whether it is a complete system or an execution environment for processes. The proposed taxonomy can be used in the academic environment to facilitate teaching processes or in the business environment to facilitate decision-making when implementing VTs.},

abstract = {Nowadays, cloud computing is gaining tremendous attention to deliver information via the internet. Virtualization plays a major role in cloud computing as it deploys multiple virtual machines on the same physical machine and thus results in improving resource utilization. Hypervisor-based virtualization and containerization are two commonly used approaches in operating system virtualization. In this article, we provide a systematic literature review on various phases in maintenance of containers including container image detection, container scheduling, container security measures, and performance evaluation of containers. We have selected 145 primary studies out of which 24% of studies are related to container performance evaluation, 42% of studies are related to container scheduling techniques, 22% of studies are related to container security measures, and 12% of studies are related to container image detection process. A few studies are related to container image detection process and evaluation of container security measures. Resource utilization is the most considered performance objective in almost all container scheduling techniques. We conclude that there is a need to introduce new tagging approaches, smell detection approaches, and also new approaches to detect and resolve threat issues in containers so that we can maintain the security of containers.},

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices continuously gather data and send the data to the cloud for further processing. However, with the recent trend of increasing number of IoT devices, billions of devices are anticipated to send data to the cloud, eventually impacting performance and cost. To solve this problem, one way is to process data locally inside edge nodes. The edge nodes are closer to the IoT devices and improve the overall performance of the system by distributing cloud tasks in edge devices. Edge devices are generally resource-constrained with limited RAM, CPU, and storage. Container technologies are ideal in edge nodes due to their isolation and being lightweight. A benchmarking scheme for containers on edge devices can help compare container technologies, hardware devices and architectures, and software. However, there is not sufficient research in this direction. So, in this work, we take a step towards developing this benchmark. We explore and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and suitability of different container technologies, including Docker, Podman, and Singularity, in the context of edge computing on ARM-based devices. Our experiments include evaluating computer vision applications that employ Haar Cascades, HOG, CNN with YOLO algorithm, and data science workloads commonly encountered in edge computing scenarios. We devised sets of performance metrics to assess container technology, including waiting time, receiving time, processing time, resource utilization, and throughput. Besides, we investigate how different container technologies optimize resource utilization and compare their efficiency on ARM-based edge devices. Our benchmarking analysis yielded valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each container technology. Our results reveal that Docker, Podman, and Singularity containers exhibit diverse resource consumption patterns and network efficiency. Docker container has better CPU and RAM utilization for most applications. Docker also boasts the lowest waiting time of approximately 0.9 seconds, comparable to native performance. In terms of processing time, Docker excels in Car detection (0.12 seconds), while Singularity and Podman outperform Docker in Object detection. Notably, native systems exhibit a remarkable improvement over containers (average of 1.2 seconds) in Object detection (0.98 seconds), highlighting the challenges of resource-intensive deep neural network algorithms on edge devices. Based on our findings, we offer practical advice for picking the best container technology for specific use cases in ARM-based edge computing. We also offer a set of benchmarking approaches and metrics that can be used to drive future research on container technologies on ARM platforms.},

abstract = {Container technology is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional virtual machines because it provides a faster, lighter, and more portable runtime environment for the applications. A container bundles the application and its binary code, libraries, and configuration files together while sharing the host operating system image. Accordingly, containers efficiently share resources and operate small micro-services, software programs, and even more extensive applications with less overhead than virtual machines. There are many container technologies available with Docker being the most popular and many technologies support multiple architectures, including the ARM architecture. Due to its energy efficiency and high-performance, which are crucial parameters in containerization, ARM architecture is becoming prevalent in container technologies. In this paper, we explore various container technologies that support ARM architecture and investigate the pros and cons of each technology. Moreover, we provide a comparative analysis of both container orchestrators and container runtimes that are most prominent competitors of Docker. We also consider security of container technologies with particular focus on the image scanning tools that supports ARM architecture. Our survey reveals that ARM technology is gaining popularity in containerization and almost all recent technologies support ARM architecture.},

abstract = {Modern scientific research challenges require new technologies, integrated tools, reusable and complex experiments in distributed computing infrastructures. But above all, computing power for efficient data processing and analyzing. Containers technologies have emerged as a new paradigm to address such intensive scientific applications problems. Their easy deployment in a reasonable amount of time and the few required computational resource make them more suitable. Containers are considered light virtualization solutions. They enable performance isolation and flexible deployment of complex, parallel, and high-performance systems. Moreover, they gained popularity to modernize and migrate scientific applications in computing infrastructure management. Additionally, they reduce computational time processing. In this paper, we first give an overview of virtualization and containerization technologies. We discuss the taxonomies of containerization technologies of the literature, and then we provide a new one that covers and completes those proposed in the literature. We identify the most important application domains of containerization and their technological progress. Furthermore, we discuss the performance metrics used in most containerization techniques. Finally, we point out research gaps in the related aspects of containerization technology that require more research.},

abstract = {[Background] Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are one of the important pillars when employing an evidence-based paradigm in Software Engineering. To date most SLRs have been conducted using a search strategy involving several digital libraries. However, significant issues have been reported for digital libraries and applying such search strategy requires substantial effort. On the other hand, snowballing has recently arisen as a potentially more efficient alternative or complementary solution. Nevertheless, it requires a relevant seed set of papers. [Aims] This paper proposes and evaluates a hybrid search strategy combining searching in a specific digital library (Scopus) with backward and forward snowballing. [Method] The proposed hybrid strategy was applied to two previously published SLRs that adopted database searches. We investigate whether it is able to retrieve the same included papers with lower effort in terms of the number of analysed papers. The two selected SLRs relate respectively to elicitation techniques (not confined to Software Engineering (SE)) and to a specific SE topic on cost estimation. [Results] Our results provide preliminary support for the proposed hybrid search strategy as being suitable for SLRs investigating a specific research topic within the SE domain. Furthermore, it helps overcoming existing issues with using digital libraries in SE. [Conclusions] The hybrid search strategy provides competitive results, similar to using several digital libraries. However, further investigation is needed to evaluate the hybrid search strategy.},

abstract = {Context: Model-Driven Security (MDS) is as a specialised Model-Driven Engineering research area for supporting the development of secure systems. Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR) is essential. Method: We conducted an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified, strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified primary MDS studies. For example, regarding security modelling artefact, we found that developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches. The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the identified primary MDS studies into 5 significant MDS studies, and other emerging or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the application of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy with database searching. This combination has delivered an extensive literature study on MDS.},

Objective: The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines. Conclusion: SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology.
