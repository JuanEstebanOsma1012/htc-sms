	abstract  = {Computational scientists often need to execute large, loosely-coupled parallel applications such as workflows and bags of tasks in order to do their research. These applications are typically composed of many, short-running, serial tasks, which frequently demand large amounts of computation and storage. In order to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, scientists would like to execute these applications using petascale resources. In the past this has been a challenge because petascale systems are not designed to execute such workloads efficiently. In this paper we describe a new approach to executing large, fine-grained workflows on distributed petascale systems. Our solution involves partitioning the workflow into independent subgraphs, and then submitting each subgraph as a self-contained MPI job to the available resources (often remote). We describe how the partitioning and job management has been implemented in the Pegasus Workflow Management System. We also explain how this approach provides an end-to-end solution for challenges related to system architecture, queue policies and priorities, and application reuse and development. Finally, we describe how the system is being used to enable the execution of a very large seismic hazard analysis application on XSEDE resources.},

	abstract = {In this paper, developments in digital computer technology since the early Fifties are reviewed briefly, and the parallelism which exists between these developments and developments in analysis and design procedures of structural engineering is identified. The recent trends in digital computer technology are examined in order to establish the fact that distributed processing is now an accepted philosophy for further developments. The impact of this on the analysis and design practices of structural engineering is assessed by first examining these practices from a data processing standpoint to identify the key operations and data bases, and then fitting them to the characteristics of distributed processing. The merits and drawbacks of the present philosophy in educating structural engineers are discussed and projections are made for the industry-academia relations in the distributed processing environment of structural analysis and design. An ongoing experiment of distributed computing in a University environment is described.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions.OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps.METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews.RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined.CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},
