\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} objective of scientific computing is to solve complex problems that often exceed human analytical capabilities~\cite{landau01}. Computers are indispensable in this context, as many real-world problems involve levels of difficulty or data scale that make purely analytical approaches infeasible, nevertheless, making use of computational resources allow these problems to be effectively addressed~\cite{landau01}.


However, not all scientific problems can be addressed by a single computer. Certain problems are computationally infeasible to execute on a single machine due to factors such as their inherent complexity or the size of their input datasets. For this reason, researchers employ distributed computing tools to produce results in a reasonable time. Some of these tools belong to the realm of High Throughput Computing (HTC), a paradigm whose goal is maximizing the volume of results produced over extended periods of time~\cite{juve-01} and that has attracted interest in the educational field~\cite{Senol-01}


Within this domain, HTCondor, developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has emerged as a workload management system designed specifically for compute-intensive applications~\cite{chang-01, htcondor-description}. HTCondor allows users to submit tasks to a pool, where the system autonomously manages resource allocation, scheduling, and distribution across nodes. Its scheduling mechanism follows a bidirectional policy: both resource owners and job submitters may define conditions and preferences that influence how and where tasks are executed~\cite{htcondor-description}.


HTCondor organizes computational jobs into distinct execution environments, known as universes. At the time of writing, the available universes include: vanilla, grid, java, scheduler, local, parallel, vm, container, and docker. This diversity reflects the system’s adaptability, ranging from traditional computing tasks to virtualized and containerized environments.


Despite this versatility, the literature lacks a systematic classification that clarifies the contexts in which HTCondor universes are applied and their broader impact. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic mapping study (SMS) with two objectives: first, to classify works across technological domains such as distributed and parallel computing, software development, virtualization, containerization, and networking; second, to identify and categorize research that leverages HTCondor universes as tools supporting core university functions such as research, teaching, outreach, and industry collaboration.
