\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivacion}
Despite the adoption of HTCondor across various scientific and technological domains, the literature reveals a notable scarcity of studies regarding the specific use of its execution universes.
The absence of a systematic classification of works related to HTCondor universes hinders informed decision-making for their implementation and limits the effective transfer of knowledge among different user communities. Furthermore, existing literature does not provide a consolidated perspective on how these universes contribute to strengthening research, teaching, and industry collaboration within an academic context.
This lack of systematized knowledge motivated the present systematic mapping study, with the aim of offering a structured and comprehensive overview that supports informed decision-making and promotes the optimal use of HTCondor across diverse application scenarios.
