\subsubsection{Defining the Search Strategy}\label{subsubsec:estrategia-busqueda}

To develop this SMS, a mixed  methodology was implemented to obtain a larger number of indexed studies from multiple sources, beyond the results provided by the digital libraries. This approach integrates two complementary search techniques. The first approach, termed \textit{database search}, involves automated searching within indexed academic databases~\cite{Jalai-01}. The second technique, called \textit{snowballing}, represents a manual procedure that uses an initial collection of seed documents to identify additional studies through their bibliographies and citations~\cite{Jalai-01,Goodman-01}.

To support this SMS process, the following resources were utilized: a) academic databases, b) the SMS-Builder software~\cite{Candela2022100935}, and c) reference management tools.
