\subsection{Reproducibility of the Review Method}
\label{sec:reproducibilidad}

With the aim of fostering the reproducibility of the review method, two verification mechanisms are provided that allow reviewers and readers to transparently access the information used in this work, which was generated using the SMS-Builder tool~\cite{sms-builder-repo}: \\

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*)]
	\item A public access link to the SMS-Builder instance containing all the data from the systematic review process: \url{https://sms-htcondor.iti.grid.uniquindio.edu.co}. The access credentials are \hbox{\textbf{\textit{``invitado''}}} for both the username and the password.
	\item A publicly available Docker image that integrates all the documentation required to build a container with the process data: \url{https://hub.docker.com/r/parritap/sms-htcondor-universes}.
\end{enumerate}
